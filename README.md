This is a simple Blazor web assembly to allow editing of document files stored in OneDrive.  The files are just json objects which store paragraphs and other elements of a document.  
This editior will create the document from the json file for the user and allow the user to edit the document.  Changes to the document will then be saved back to the json file.
